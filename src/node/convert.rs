//! Node Conversion
//!
//! This module defines a trait [`Conversion`] which is called by the
//! [`Node::convert`] method. The `Convert` trait is used to convert between
//! one node type and another, controlling several nuanced aspects of the
//! conversion. Specifically:
//!
//! 1. Cached data can be translated from the old type to the new one.
//! 2. Witness data can be provided (or translated from the old witness type,
//!    if it was nontrivial) to attach to witness nodes.
//! 3. For `case` nodes, the decision can be made to hide one of the children.
//!    In this case the `case` node is converted to an `AssertL` or `AssertR`
//!    node, depending which child was hidden.
//!

/// The primary trait controlling how a node conversion is done.
///
/// When a node is converted using [`Node::convert`], the original DAG rooted at
/// that node is traversed in post order. For each node, the following steps are
/// taken:
///
/// 1. First, [`Self::visit_node`] is called, before any other checks are
///    done. This happens regardless of the node's type or whether it is going
///    to be pruned.
///
///    This method is provided for convenience and does not affect the course
///    of the algorithm. It has a default implementation which does nothing.
///
/// 2. Then, if the node is a witness node, `Self::convert_witness` is called
///    to obtain witness data.
///
/// 3. If the node is a case node, [`Self::prune_case`] is called to decide
///    whether to prune either child of the node (turning the `case` into an
///    `assertl` or `assertr`). The default implementation hides neither.
///
/// 4. Finally, the node's data is passed to [`Self::convert_data`], whose job
///    it is to compute the cached data for the new node. For `case` combinators
///    where one child was pruned, `convert_data` will receive an `assertl` or
///    `assertl`, as appropriate, rather than a `case`.
///
/// If any method returns an error, then iteration is aborted immediately and
/// the error returned to the caller. If the converter would like to recover
/// from errors and/or accumulate multiple errors, it needs to do this by
/// tracking errors internally.
///
/// The finalization method will not return any errors except those returned by
/// methods on [`Converter`].
pub trait Converter<N: Marker, M: Marker> {
    /// The error type returned by the methods on this trait.
