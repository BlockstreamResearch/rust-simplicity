//! Type Inference Context
//!
//! When constructing a Simplicity program, you must first create a type inference
//! context, in which type inference occurs incrementally during construction. Each
//! leaf node (e.g. `unit` and `iden`) must explicitly refer to the type inference
//! context, while combinator nodes (e.g. `comp`) infer the context from their
//! children, raising an error if there are multiple children whose contexts don't
//! match.
//!
//! This helps to prevent situations in which users attempt to construct multiple
//! independent programs, but types in one program accidentally refer to types in
//! the other.
//!

/// Can be cheaply cloned with [`Context::shallow_clone`]. These clones will

/// There is currently no way to create an independent context with the same
/// type inference variables (i.e. a deep clone). If you need this functionality,
