//! Types and Type Inference
//!
//! Every Simplicity expression has two types associated with it: a source and
//! a target. We refer to this pair of types as an "arrow". The types are
//! inferred from the structure of the program.
//!
//! Simplicity types are one of three things
//!   * A unit type, which has one value
//!   * A sum of two other types
//!   * A product of two other types
//!
//! During type inference, types are initially "free", meaning that there are
//! no constraints on what they will eventually be. The program structure then
//! imposes additional constraints (for example, the `comp` combinator requires
//! that its left child's target type be the same as its right child's source
//! type), and by unifying all these constraints, all types can be inferred.
//!
//! If a type has no free children we refer to it as "complete". The inference
//! code, when it notices that a type has become complete, populates its cached
//! `Final` structure, which can then be accessed using the `final_data` method.
//! If this structure is populated we refer to the type as "finalized".
//!
//! Generally speaking, "complete" and "finalized" can be considered synonyms,
//! though this is not strictly true because types may become complete indirectly,
//! by their children becoming complete, without the inference algorithm updating
//! the `Final` structure.
//!
//! It may be the case that some types are still free even after all constraints
//! are considered. The `finalize` function completes all types by setting any
//! free types to the unit type.
//!
//! In addition to requiring that type inference succeeds (i.e. no constraints
//! are in conflict with each other), there is one additional check, the "occurs
//! check", which ensures that there are no infinitely-sized types. Such types
//! occur when a type has itself as a child, and are illegal in Simplicity. This
//! check is explicitly done by `finalize`, to avoid infinitely looping, but any
//! final type is guaranteed to pass the occurs-check, whether it was finalized
//! explicitly or during unification.
//!
//! There are four main types in this module:
//!   * `Type` is the main type representing a Simplicity type, whether it is
//!     complete or not. Internally it contains a mutex holding a `TypeInner`
//!     which in turn contains a `Constraint`, but these are not public types
//!     and not exposed to users.
//!   * `Final` is a mutex-free structure that can be obtained from a complete
//!     type. It includes the TMR and the complete bound describing the type.
//!   * `Constraint` defines whether a given type is free, bound to a particular
//!     `Bound`, or equal to another type.
//!   * `Bound` defines the structure of a type: whether it is a unit, or the
//!     sum or product of two other types.
//!
